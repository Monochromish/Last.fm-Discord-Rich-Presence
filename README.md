An elegant, efficient, easy-to-setup and arguably the best Last.fm discord rich presence! Written in Electron with daisyUI.

Supports GIF album covers and provides information such as `Track name`, `Track Album`, `Track Artist`, `Last Played`, `Your Scrobbles` and much more!
Customizable and by default, it updates status every 30 seconds.
